# bucket_list_304

## Setup
To test the site locally, PHP local servers are a good option.

When cloning the git repository to your local machine you may have to change the permissions. You can do this my running the following in your terminal:

`find [INSERT FOLDER NAME] -type f -exec chmod 755 {} \;`


Next, if you are using PHP local servers then run the following:
`php -S localhost:8000`

## DEV NOTES
need to work on:
- admin.php
- user.php
- event.php, activity.php, food.php (or combine?)
