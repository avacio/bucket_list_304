Function printTable created by Raghav Thakur on 2018-11-15.

Input:  takes in a result returned from your SQL query and an array of
        strings of the column names
Output: prints an HTML table of the results returned from your SQL query.

printTable is an easy way to iteratively print the columns of a table, 
instead of having to manually print out each column which can be
cumbersome and lead to duplicate code all over the place.

If you will be making calls to printTable multiple times and intend to
use it for multiple php files, please do the following:

Step 1) Create a new php file and copy the printTable function and the
        associated HTML styling code into the file you created, give
        this file a meaningful name such as 'print-table.php'.
        (Search for "style" above.)

Step 2) In whichever file you want to use the printTable function,
        assuming this file also contains the server code to communicate
        with the database:  Type in "include 'print-table.php'" without
        double quotes.  If the file in which you want to use printTable
        is not in the root directory, you'll need to specify the path of 
        root directory where 'print-table.php' is.  As an example:
        "include '../print-table.php'" without double quotes.

Step 3) You can now make calls to the printTable function without 
        needing to redeclare it in your current file.

Note:  You can move all the server code into a separate file called 
       'server.php' in a similar way, except whichever file needs to
       use the server code needs to have "require 'server.php'" without
       double quotes.  So, you might have something like what's shown
       below in each file:

require 'server.php';
require 'print-table.php'

Using printTable as an example:

Note: PHP uses '$' to declare variables

$result = executePlainSQL("SELECT CUST_ID, NAME, PHONE_NUM FROM CUSTOMERS");

$columnNames = array("Customer ID", "Name", "Phone Number");
printTable($result, $columnNames); // this will print the table
                                   // in the current webpage

*/

function printTable($resultFromSQL, $namesOfColumnsArray)
{
    echo "<br>Here is the output, nicely formatted:<br>";
    echo "<table>";
    echo "<tr>";
    // iterate through the array and print the string contents
    foreach ($namesOfColumnsArray as $name) {
        echo "<th>$name</th>";
    }
    echo "</tr>";

    while ($row = OCI_Fetch_Array($resultFromSQL, OCI_BOTH)) {
        echo "<tr>";
        $string = "";

        // iterates through the results returned from SQL query and
        // creates the contents of the table
        for ($i = 0; $i < sizeof($namesOfColumnsArray); $i++) {
            $string .= "<td>" . $row["$i"] . "</td>";
        }
        echo $string;
        echo "</tr>";
    }
    echo "</table>";
}
